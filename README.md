# Amino-Enhancement-Suite
Tired of that clustered experience that amino gives you when reading blogs on PC? Well, suffer no more.

**With AHS you can:**

<ul>
	<li>Hide the amino banner</li>
	<li>Hide the animated comments</li>
	<li>Hide the annoying fog on the community list sidebar</li>
	<li>Acommodate the navigation buttons</li>
</ul>

Want to see an element again? Just click on the addon's button to configure it to your liking!
