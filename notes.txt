Q: How does this addon even work??

A: First, as soon as a blog is opened on aminoapps.com, addon.js hides/modifies all of the annoying elements[1]
Then, when the extension's icon is clicked, menu.html pops up and runs checkBoxes.js

checkBoxes.js loads "toggleResources.js" on the aminoapps page and then creates event listeners for the checkboxes in menu.html; Each individual checkbox has it's inidivual function to check it's state and modify aminoapps.com html accordingly to what the user wants.
When an event is triggered, the checkbox is evaluated and a message is sent to toggleResources.js with "browser.tabs.sendMessage".
Then toggleResources.js modifies the "display" css propierty of the according element.


[1]: The annoying elements are: The Banner, Navigation Buttons, Overflow button of the Navigation Buttons, Community list Blur, Live Comments.

checkBoxes.js

Q: Why not use "browser.tabs.insertCSS" to DISPLAY the elements accordingly?
A: Becouse addon.js hides the element by putting the CSS value ON the html itself, wich makes it override whathever is on the pages imported CSS
Q: Then why not use "browser.tabs.insertCSS" on addon.js as well?
A: Becouse we can't: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/tabs/insertCSS
